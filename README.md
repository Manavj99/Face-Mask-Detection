# Real-Time Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **real-time face mask detection system** using deep learning and computer vision.  
It was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor mask compliance in public and workplace environments.  
The system identifies whether a person is wearing a mask properly and triggers alerts for non-compliance.  

This work is also published in the **International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews (IJRAR), June 2022, Vol. 9, Issue 2** as:  

> **Automatic Face Mask Detection for Covid-19**  
> *Authors: Prof. Devika Rani Roy, Kanchan Yadav, Manav Jaiswal, Sameer Jadhav*

The proposed system achieves **95.77% training accuracy** and **94.58% testing accuracy** on benchmark datasets.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time detection using webcam or video input  
- Trained CNN model for mask / no-mask classification  
- Alerts via **buzzer sound** (`alarm.wav`) or **voice announcement** (`announce.mp3`)  
- Automatic **screenshot capture** of violations  
- GUI support with custom backgrounds and narration  
- Dataset augmentation for robust performance

## 📸 Screenshots
_Add detection results, GUI screenshots, or flowcharts here._  

Example flow:  
1. ✅ Mask detected (green)  
2. ❌ No mask detected (red alert + alarm)  
3. ⚠️ Improper mask detected (warning)
